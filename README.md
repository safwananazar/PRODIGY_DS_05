# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Welcome to the repository for my traffic accident data analysis project. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving insights from a dataset containing traffic accident records.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analysis includes visualizing accident hotspots and identifying key contributing factors to inform strategies for improving road safety.

## Data Sources

- **Dataset:** [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** For data analysis and visualization (libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn).
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For documenting the analysis process and results.

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, converted data types, and ensured consistency across the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the distribution and relationships of key variables to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Visualization:** Created various plots and charts to visually represent the data and findings.

## Conclusion

In this traffic data analysis project, we undertook a comprehensive examination of the accident records, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Here are the key findings and observations from the analysis:

### 1. City-wise Accident Distribution
- Miami stands out as the city with the highest number of accidents. This could be attributed to its high population density and traffic volume.
- Star Junction and Stromsburg are among the cities with the least number of accidents, possibly due to their smaller size and lower traffic.

### 2. State-wise Accident Distribution
- California reports the highest number of accident cases, which aligns with its large population and extensive road network.
- Conversely, South Dakota (SD) has the least number of accident cases, likely due to its lower population density and traffic volume.

### 3. Yearly Accident Rates
- The year 2021 recorded the highest accident rates, indicating a potential increase in traffic or changes in reporting during this period.

### 4. Accident Severity
- The severity of accidents is categorized into four levels: 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Most people experienced accidents at severity level 2, suggesting that while many accidents occurred, they were not extremely severe.

### 5. Weather Conditions During Accidents
- Fair weather conditions were prevalent during most of the accidents, indicating that factors other than adverse weather, such as driver behavior or traffic congestion, may play a significant role in accident occurrences.

### 6. Time of Day for Accidents
- Most accidents occurred in the morning, potentially due to rush hour traffic when more people are commuting to work or school.

These observations provide valuable insights into traffic patterns and accident hotspots, which can inform policy decisions, urban planning, and safety measures aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of accidents. These insights can help in developing strategies to reduce accident rates and improve road safety.
